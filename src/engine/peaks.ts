/**
 * `height` is a pure game-mechanic "steps to summit" pacing number, tuned
 * per peak against `pacingSimulation.test.ts` — it deliberately isn't a
 * smooth ascending 20-30 curve anymore. Once `selectGenerator` went fully
 * exclusive per peak (a peak only ever draws its own matched generator(s),
 * see `registry.ts`), each peak's pacing became driven entirely by its own
 * matched generator's `TIME_LIMIT_MULTIPLIER` — a peak matched to a slow
 * type (e.g. Leap Crag's `countBetween`, 1.5x) needs a *shorter* climb to
 * land in the same 2-5 minute band as a peak matched to a fast one (e.g.
 * Basecamp Bluff's `readAnalog`, 1.0x, which needed a *taller* climb once
 * it stopped being diluted by slower off-theme questions). Don't "clean
 * this back up" into a tidy ascending sequence without re-running the
 * pacing simulation across every peak and difficulty first.
