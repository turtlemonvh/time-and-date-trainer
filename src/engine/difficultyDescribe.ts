 * fall back to a uniform draw if every on-theme generator weighs 0) rather
 * than reading `profile.answerModeWeights` directly. That distribution
 * describes the *site-wide* mix across all three modes; a peak's on-theme
 * generator set can make some or all of those modes unreachable regardless
 * of it — e.g. Basecamp Bluff's only on-theme generator, `readAnalog`, is
 * always `choice`, so no difficulty level can make it draw a `free`-mode
 * question even at a difficulty where `free` is the site-wide dominant
 * mode. This was issue #78: the curriculum page's "Answer style" bullet
 * and the sample question it sits next to could describe two different
 * generators.
 *
 * Summing weight per mode across every on-theme generator (rather than
 * comparing the three `answerModeWeights` numbers directly) also matters
 * for a peak with several on-theme generators unevenly split across modes
 * (e.g. peak 10, on-theme for everything, has 7 `choice` generators but
 * only 2 `interactive` ones) — `selectGenerator` draws a generator, not a
 * mode, so a mode backed by more generators is more likely to be drawn
 * even at an equal per-generator weight.
