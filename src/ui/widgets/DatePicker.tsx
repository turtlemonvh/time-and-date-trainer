/**
 * A thin wrapper around `CalendarMonth` for picking an arbitrary date,
 * possibly after browsing to a different month than the one it opened on.
 * Deliberately doesn't try to keep `CalendarMonth`'s `highlightDay` in sync
 * with the pick — that prop is designed around "the highlighted day's month
 * is the one in view" (readCalendar's use case), which stops holding the
 * moment a picked date and the current browse position are in different
 * months. The text summary below the grid is the source of truth for what's
 * picked; showing it as a persistent highlighted cell across navigation
 * would need `CalendarMonth` to become a controlled component, which
 * nothing needs yet.
